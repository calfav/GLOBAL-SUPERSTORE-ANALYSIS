## Project Overview

The core objective of this data analysis project is to delve into the sales performance data of Global Superstore over the previous year. Through a comprehensive analysis of sales metrics and key performance indicators, the aim is to uncover actionable insights that will empower management to make informed strategic decisions for the upcoming year. This project seeks to provide a profound understanding of the company's performance and illuminate pathways for improvement and growth.

## Data sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "orders.csv", and "people.csv" and "returns.csv" files containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

## Tools

1. Excel: It was used for Data cleaning.
2. SQL: It was used for Exploratory Data Analysis
3. PowerBI: It was used for creating Visualizations
4. PowerPoint: It was used for presentation

  ## Data cleaning

  I performed the following tasks in the data preparation phase;

  1. Data inspection
  2. Checking and handling duplicate values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
  4. Converting the data to a standard Excel table

## Exploratory data analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

1. What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
2.  For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
3. Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
4. Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?
5. What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance?
6. Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
7.  Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified earlier?
8.  Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders.
9.  Why is this city’s average profit so low?
10.  Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
11.  Which customer returned items and what segment do they belong
12.  Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis and results, I recommend the following actions;

 - Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue for example January(new year season), February(Valentine's season), and April (Easter season).
 - Miss. Nancy is the best-performing salesperson of the year, it is recommended she gets promoted to the western region of the company to improve the company's productivity.
 - Ms. Jan has the lowest sales on the list, she needs some more courses on learning about marketing.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
